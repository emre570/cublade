# üó°Ô∏è cuBlade ‚Äî Modular CUDA kernel library

A growing toolbox of GPU blades:
from matmul to softmax, each operator is hand-tuned, lightweight, and production-ready.
Plug in only what you need, or forge your own.

## Installation

uv is recommended for installation, since it's faster than pip.

You must install PyTorch on your own based on your CUDA version.

`uv pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128`
